# MacAulayLab-RNAseq1

This work have been done in collaboration with the MacAulay Lab.
All programs used are free and open-source.
Feel free to copy and use code, but make sure to cite: XXXXXXXX (coming soon)

## The RNAseq and Analysis follows these steps:

### Step 0: RNA-STAR setup and analysis #
Get the RNA-STAR quantmode output

### Step 1: "Step 1 - TPM_converter" file
Converts the RNA-STAR output to TPM

### Step 2: "Step 2 - Get gene information" file
Get gene information of all genes in the sample

### Step 3: "Step 3 - Get Go-term information for filtration" file
Get Go-term information of all genes in the sample for filtration

### Step 4: "Step 4 - Transport and pumps" & "Step 4 - Water and Ion Channels" files
Get all "the transporter and pumps" and "the water and ion channels" genes in two seperate files

### Step 5: "Step 5 - Transport and pumps - Membrane Filtration" & "Step 5 - Water and Ion channels - Membrane Filtration" files
Filters all the genes in the two files to only contain proteins in plasma membrane
